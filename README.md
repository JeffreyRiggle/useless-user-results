# useless-user-results
These are the results of the useless user testing. The objective of the test was to compare the performance of Aurelia, Angular 4 and React.

## Web Server
## Aurelia
## Angular
## React

# Conducting the test.
In order to conduct the test an instance of the useless-user-gen was started on my machine. Once this was started I started a web server hosting either the Aurelia, Angular 4 or React application.

Once this was done I created 1000 users 3 times, Updated 1000 users 3 times and cleared out the users.
